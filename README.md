### 1. Sherlock â€” Noxious (LLMNR Poisoning)
- **Platform:** [HackTheBox Sherlock](https://labs.hackthebox.com/achievement/sherlock/2781127/747)  
- **Overview:** Detected and investigated unusual LLMNR traffic on the internal Active Directory VLAN. A rogue host (`(hostname)` at `(IP address)`) captured an NTLMv2 hash from `(username)` due to a typo when navigating a file share (`(typo)`). Extracted NTLM artifacts from the PCAP and successfully cracked the password (`(password)`) to confirm its complexity and verify attacker access.  
  
- **Skills:**  
  - Network threat hunting (LLMNR poisoning detection)  
  - Packet capture analysis (Wireshark / tshark)  
  - NTLM hash extraction and cracking (Hashcat)  
  - Incident documentation and SOC reporting
